  bio: Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

## What is a Validator?

Validators are special actors in the network responsible for adding new blocks of transactions to the blockchain. Anyone can declare themselves as validator candidate, but only 125 candidates can enter the set of active validators. Validator candidates are chosen based on the amount of voting power associated with their operator account. Voting power is obtained when ATOM holders start staking, in proportion of the amount of ATOMs staked. This voting power must then be [delegated](#what-is-delegating?) to one or multiple validator candidates. As a result, ATOM holders will have to choose validator(s) when they stake. 

In order to add blocks to the blockchain, validators electronically sign block proposals that are valid according to the protocol (the proposer of a given block is selected among validators according to a specific algorithm, and rotates every block). Each signature is weighted by the voting power of the validator, and a block is considered valid if it is signed twice by more than two thirds of validators, weighted by their respective voting power.
