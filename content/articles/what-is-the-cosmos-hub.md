  bio: Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

## What is the Cosmos Hub?

The Cosmos Hub is the first blockchain in the Cosmos Network. The goal of the Cosmos Hub is to facilitate the connection between the multitude of blockchains that will eventually comprise the Cosmos Network. As it will connect to many blockchains, and strive to have high security, the Cosmos Hub will also be in prime position to become one of the biggest decentralized custodian for digitial assets.
