  bio: Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

## What is Staking?

Staking is the process of locking up a digital asset (ATOM in the case of the Cosmso Hub) in order to provide economic security for a public blockchain. Public blockchains are permissionless networks, meaning anyone is free to participate in maintaining them. As a result, it is possible for some of the maintainers of the network (called [validators](#what-is-a-validator-?)) to act maliciously. In order to incentivise maintainers to behave in the best interest of the network, the locked up assets are at risk of being partially slashed (i.e. destroyed) if evidence is brought that a fault was committed. For more, see [Risks].

Note that due to practical constraints of the software, the number of validators on the Cosmos Hub has to be capped (currently at 125). This does not mean that ATOM holders that do not operate validators themselves can't participate in securing the network. In fact, ATOMs are designed to let each holder participate in securing the network via a mechanism called [delegation](#what-is-delegating?). When ATOM holders stake their ATOMs, they must choose one or more validator to delegate to. They will then be eligible for receiving rewards, but also be at [risk of slashing] if the validator(s) they chose misbehave.
