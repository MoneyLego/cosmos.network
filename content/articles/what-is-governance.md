  bio: Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

## What is Governance?

Governance refers to the ability for stakers to vote on proposals that affect the evolution of the network. Proposals can be submitted by any ATOM holder, but only proposals that come with a sufficient deposit (current minimum deposit is 512 ATOMs) are eligible to be voted on. Deposits can be crowdfunded and need not be entirely provided by the user submitting the proposal. 

Once a proposal gets sufficient deposit, it enters the voting period, which lasts for 14 days. Most block explorers show the currently active proposals. ATOM stakers can vote on such proposals, with a voting power proportional to their amount of staked ATOMs. If they do not vote, they inherit the vote from the validator(s) they delegated to. Voting can be performed via most [Wallets].
