  bio: Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

## What will IBC enable on the Cosmos Hub?

Cosmos Hub will be one of the first blockchain to implement IBC. While any feature must be approved by the Hub's governance in order to be adopted, it is likely that IBC will enable many new features such as:

- Inter-blockchain token transfers: From their Cosmos Hub wallet, users will be able to hold, send and receive tokens originating from other blockchains. The number of available tokens will grow as the number of IBC connexions with the Cosmos Hub increases.
- Interchain Staking: IBC will enable Cosmos Hub validators to provide security for other chains. In practice, it means that ATOMs will be able to secure both the Cosmos Hub and other chains. Validators will be able to select the chains they validate, and their delegators will share the resulting risks and rewards. 

These two features are excepted to be implemented early, but many others will likely see the light of day.
