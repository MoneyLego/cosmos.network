  bio: Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

## What rewards can be expected when staking ATOMs?

Staking rewards come from two different sources:

- **ATOM inflation**: The total supply of ATOM is inflated each block to reward delegators. The inflation rate is a global parameter calculated based on the percentage of ATOM staked.
- **Transaction fees**: Each transaction processed by the network comes with transaction fees, that can be paid in multiple token denominations. These transaction fees are collected by the network and distributed to each delegator proportional to their stake. 

Staking rewards are automatically collected, but they must be actively withdrawn by delegators by sending of a transaction in order to become available. This can be done via [Wallets]. Note that the [validator commission] is deduced from rewards before they are distributed.
