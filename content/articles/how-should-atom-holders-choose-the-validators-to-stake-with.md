  bio: Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

## How should ATOM holders choose the Validator(s) to stake with? 

In order to choose validator(s), ATOM holders have access to a range of information directly in [Lunie](https://lunie.io) or other [Cosmos block explorers]():

- **Validator's moniker**: Name of the validator candidate.
- **Validator's description**: Description provided by the validator operator.
- **Validator's website**: Link to the validator's website.
- **Initial commission rate**: The [commission](#what-is-a-validator's-commission) rate on rewards charged to any delegator by the validator. 
- **Commission max change rate:** The maximum daily increase of the validator's commission. This parameter cannot be changed by the validator operator. 
- **Maximum commission:** The maximum commission rate this validator candidate can charge. This parameter cannot be changed by the validator operator. 
- **Minimum self-bond amount**: Minimum amount of ATOMs the validator candidate need to have bonded at all time. If the validator's self-bonded stake falls below this limit, their entire staking pool (i.e. all its delegators) will unbond. This parameter exists as a safeguard for delegators. Indeed, when a validator misbehaves, part of their total stake gets slashed. This included the validator's self-delegateds stake as well as their delegators' stake. Thus, a validator with a high amount of self-delegated ATOMs has more skin-in-the-game than a validator with a low amount. The minimum self-bond amount parameter guarantees to delegators that a validator will never fall below a certain amount of self-bonded stake, thereby ensuring a minimum level of skin-in-the-game. This parameter can only be increased by the validator operator. 

Beyond these on-chain information, delegators are encouraged to visit validators' respective websites in order to learn more about their operation and security practices.
