  bio: Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

## What is the Blockchain?

The blockchain is a technology that enables the development of permissionless decentralized applications. It does so by providing a method to securely replicate a ledger among parties that do not necessarily trust each other. In other words, blockchains allow the creation of a new kind of digital application that do not require a central coordinator to operate. Think electronic money without central banks, digital asset trading without centrally-operated stock exchanges, or social network platforms without central administrators.
