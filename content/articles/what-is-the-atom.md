  bio: Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

The ATOM is the Cosmos Hub’s primary token, and secures the Hub’s valuable interchain services. If you hold ATOM, you can temporarily lock them up in order to contribute to the security of the Cosmos Hub via a mechanism called [Staking](/learn/faq/what-is-staking). In exchange for locking them up, you will receive [rewards](/learn/faq/what-rewards-can-be-expected-when-staking-atoms) newly minted ATOM as well a share of the transaction fees collected by the blockchain. However, do note that staking [is not risk free](/learn/faq/what-are-the-risks-associated-with-staking). 

By staking ATOM, you will also be able to vote in Cosmos Hub governance decisions.
